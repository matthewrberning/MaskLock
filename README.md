## Mask Detection and Physical Security System



Healthcare and Epidemiological experts have **repeatedly** recommended the use of
properly-worn face-coverings in public spaces broadly and in reopened businesses specifically
to prevent the unchecked spread of the [SARS-CoV-II virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2). In certain areas there is
considerable resistance to the use of face-coverings for a variety of reasons. 

This project will provide a solution for small business owners and individuals wishing to automatically restrict access to their private property to only those who are properly complying with the use of such face-coverings. Our project will also provide feedback to individuals presenting improper compliance or attempting to fool the face-covering detection application, thereby encouraging
them to use the face-coverings correctly. Through this solution we aim to help our users protect
themselves, the individuals helped towards compliance, and by extension all individuals at risk
from the virus.
